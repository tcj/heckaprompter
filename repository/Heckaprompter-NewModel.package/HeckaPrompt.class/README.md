A prompt is a combination of a clipart and blurb.  It's essentially just an association.  

Typically when a prompt is presented to a user, the clipart and blurb will be chosen randomly.  The user then has the opportunity to cycle through the blurbs and clipart randomly (like spinning a wheel in a game).  The user may then choose to contribute a blurb of their own, which is (perhaps) inspired by the combination of clipart and blurb provided to them (and which they may or may not have had some agency in building/associating, by "spinning the wheel").
